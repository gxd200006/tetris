## Description

Tetris- a game where blocks fall from the top of the screen and have to be lined up by the player. When the player fills a horizontal line with blocks, the line clears and the blocks above move down to fill the missing line. The blocks continue to fall until the stack reaches the top of the screen, when the game will end.

## Features

- Feature 1

	- Randomly selected pre-defined blocks will fall from the top of the screen at a set speed, and the rotation & horizontal movement will be controlled by the player

- Feature 2

	- When a line is filled, it clears and the blocks move down

- Feature 3

	- Displays the next block on the side

- Feature 4

	- Score counter- increases when a line is cleared

## Challenges

- I’m going to have to figure out how to move the rest of the blocks down after a line is cleared

- I need to draw the grid and figure out a good size for the tetris blocks

## Outcomes

Ideal Outcome:

- A working Tetris game, ideally with a fall speed increase if the down button is pressed, and instant drop if spacebar is pressed. Score will be calculated and displayed and the next block will be shown on the side. A ‘store block’ feature, where when a button is pressed it stores that block for later, and if pressed later will swap the block falling down for the held block. A start menu will be will open up when the game is launched, with a how to play screen as well. A game over screen will pop up when the player loses.

Minimal Viable Outcome:

- A bare Tetris game, with blocks that can rotate but have no increased speed when down or space is pressed. The next block is shown but the score is not calculated.

## Milestones

- Week 1

  1. Create base UI layout

  2. Create classes and base code for game

- Week 2

  1. Implement code- working prototype at this stage

  2. Blocks spawn from the top and fall down, stacking on top of each other

- Week 3

  1. Blocks clear when a line is created

  2. Begin implementing aesthetics- coded shapes at this point, but if ahead of time use a simple image sprite instead

- Week 4

  1. Implement UI- score board & next block

  2. If possible, add ‘store block’ feature
